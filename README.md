# LedBadge
An attempt at creating a cross-platform version of LedBadge using Qt6.

## Notes
Development starts from the v1.0 release of LedBadge, because it's the only version that works with the B1248 badge that I have.
I intend to at least try to bring some of the newer features over to this though!
